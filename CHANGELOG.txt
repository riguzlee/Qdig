Added not-seeing-thumbs hint to the troubleshooting section of INSTALL.txt.
Completely rewrote the aging and decrepit Navigation Row sizer code.

  small black letters on a yellow background, which looks icon-like.
Added an $excl_img_pattern setting that excludes images if they contain
  certain text in the filename.  Default text '_thumb'.
Added an absolute-path option.  You can now make galleries using images
  in a specific directory elsewhere (that is, outside what would normally
  be the gallery tree) by specifying the filesystem and URL locations of
  the directory.
Added a setting to force output of HTML headers and footers.  Now they
  can be forced on or off.

Added Safe Mode detection to the diagnostic messages.
Improved compatibility with servers running with PHP's open_basedir

  is ignored (for $Qtmp).
Added capability for styling the thumbnail for the currently displayed
  image differently from the rest of the thumbnails.  (Requested by Jeremy
  Smith, assistance by GloryFish.)
Thumbnail wrapping should now be the same whether Safe Mode enabled or not.

  HTTP GET parameters. (Requested by David B. Nagle.)
Added an option to left-justify captions. (Suggested by ZATZAi.)
The thumbnail filename prefix now includes the thumbnail size.  Now when you
  change thumbnail size new thumbnails will automatically be generated.
Added capability to inject settings into Qdig via a qdig_settings() function.
  (Requested by David B. Nagle.)
Now no captions directory is created if $touch_captions is set to FALSE.
Reworked the Security Check code.

  Now when thumbs need to be converted the page appears quickly and the
  thumbs appear one-by-one as they're converted.
Now only convert the requested size of a resized image unless the option
  to convert individually ($cnvrt_alt['indiv']) is turned off.  If it's
  off, all images in the directory are converted to of all enabled sizes.
Added code to disable thmb_onfly when gallery is not stand-alone.  Qdig needs
  to be requested directly for it to work (because headers are already sent).
Improved gdVersion() function and the corresponding diagnostic message.  Now
  if phpinfo() is disabled the script works appropriately.  Also now don't use phpinfo()
  unless necessary.  If GD extension is loaded and  phpinfo() is disabled, settle for
  GD v1 rather than no GD at all.
Setting $thmb_enable to FALSE disables thumbs view more effectively now.
Much minor code cleanup.  Improved HTML Header.  Moved some settings.
Added new HTML Header CSS settings to put a border around the displayed
  image with configurable color and width.

Security violations now produce informative message output rather than
  the old way (a blank page with an HTML comment).
A maximum number of characters in an image name and / or pathname may be set.
There's a new $extra_paranoia setting, which increases sensitivity to '..'
  within filenames and pathnames.
There are new options to ignores "dotfiles" and "dotdirs", which are files
  and directories that start with '.'.
You may enable a Cache-Control HTML header tag and specify the expiration time
  for certain servers that cause thumbnail images to be repeatedly reloaded.
You can specify directory names that will be ignored as gallery directories.
You can specify image names that will not be displayed in galleries.
There's a new setting to ignore images in the root (Main) directory, which
  forces a subdirectories-only gallery.
You can specify extra parameters in URLs generated by Qdig, which can
  sometimes be useful for an embedded gallery.

Changed <font> tags into <span> tags for improved XHTML compatibility.
Added a setting to set a full URL to the admin.php script.

2004-05-23
Added a new Server Compatibility setting that inserts a Cache-Control <meta>

  changes relative to Qdig 1.05:
By far the biggest improvement is the capability to keep writable

  (feature that was added 12/17) was broken.

2/25/04
Fixed behavior where sometimes caption text would not be displayed.

  calling script to be the topmost directory of a gallery tree.  This should
  help people who are including a gallery within another script.  This is
  in addition to the capability of chrooting single-directory galleries.

12/19/03
Improved the behavior of singleton images.  Now viewing a singleton should be
  the same as an image among others, but without prev/next first/last links.

All temporary image sizes now link back to the default-view size.

12/17/03

When you view an Original image (via the `Original' link in a Navigation
  Row) it's similarly linked back to the default resized version now.

12/10/03
Created a new gdVersion() function to determine the GD version (i.e. 1 or 2).

New capability:  Subdirectories can be isolated as individual galleries now.
  If you disable Directory Navigation, then each subdirectory gallery will
  appear stand-alone.  Linking to a gallery links to that gallery only.

9/6/03
Code cleanup: Switch to array variables where appropriate, etc.
Fixed bug where only one subdir is displayed if there are duplicate mtimes.

Mostly continued to refine the Directory Navigation code.
Enabled small-text option for Directory Navigation row.
Added checkForDirs() function.  Now only directories with images and / or

Functions that printed directly now now return values.  (Major change)
Now concatenating text instead of using variables inside double-quoted strings.
  This was supposed to improve efficiency.
  
12/29/02 - Fixed special-characters issue that resurfaced due to reformatting.
12/28/02 - Remove lines from header.  Began adapting admin.php so it's
           useful for Qdig-specific or general-purpose use.
12/27/02 - More clarification of settings and variable names.
12/26/02 - Added version variable.  Moved image conversion variable settings
           so they're together.  Changed some variable names.  Reversed order
           in CHANGELOG.txt.  Rearranged more settings for clarity.
12/23/02 - Changed HTML header.  Some comment changes and spelling corrections.
12/21/02 - Now encoding ampersands in URLs for compatibility with (XHTML)
           standards.  Updated INSTALL.txt to reflect changes in the script.
12/20/02 - Added safety checks to see if converted images directory is
           available.  Consolidated navigation variables into a single array.  
12/19/02 - Added settings to disable presenting the XL, L, and M size options.
           More code cleanup for consistence and bug squashing.
12/18/02 - Code cleanup for consistency and minor bug squashing.  Twiddled
           with font size and alignment in footer row.
12/12/02 - Reformatted script for fewer lines of code.  Renamed project to
           Qdig.  Now detects presence of favicon.
12/11/02 - Moved visitor-selectable default view to control bar and created
           a one-time alternate size component to navigation bar. Added
           misc. safety checks.  Misc. bug cleanup and tweaking.
12/10/02 - Improved resizing functions.  Added visitor-selectable default 
           image size to navigation bar.
12/09/02 - Added a couple of security checks.  Created function to generate
           alternate-sized images.  Added visitor-controllable "links view"
           selection of thumbs/names/numerals to the control bar.
12/08/02 - Now when filenames are used for text links they're displayed in
           a sidebar to the left of the image area.  New first image and
           last image links (`|<<' and `>>|') for the nav bar.  Started on
           a "Control Bar," which will display the location (subdir), some
           visitor-configurable settings, and the `site home' link.
12/07/02 - Made the settings section less verbose.  Zapped one more special-
           character bug.  Added some security checks.
12/06/02 - Reformatted the script to make it easier to read.  Reviewed and
           corrected global variable usage.  Developed an auto-wrapping
           feature for thumbnail and text numeral  links (not yet useful
           for filename text links).
12/05/02 - Created a function to get the image number.  Rearranged variables
           so functions only use globals when it makes sense.  Added filename
           option for text image links.  Added "small text" option for text
           image links.  Fixed a few more special-characters bugs.
12/04/02 - Now passing image names instead of image numbers in URLs, so
           the images are "bookmarkable".  Added directory support in URL
           in preparation for subdir support.  Switched from while() to
           foreach() loops in imageLinks functions.  Image list is now
           sorted alphabetically.  Fixed nasty `slashes' problem.

           for clarity.  Improved script layout for ease-of-use.  No longer
           sometimes creating empty navigation tables.  Fixed special-char-
           acters bug using rawurlencode() for image src="" attributes.

           to double-quotes around `convert' parameters.

           section.  Added lots of user configuration settings. Adapted
           phpFileFarm to use as a web interface to the gallery.
11/29/02 - Added optional thumbnail prefixes to help avoid accidental over-
           writing of files.  Added caption support.  Clarified comments.
