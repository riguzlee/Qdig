Basic Instructions:

- Place the script (index.php) in a web-accessible directory with some
  image files and/or subdirectories that contain image files.
- Browse the directory's URL.


Basic Instructions (with writable-tree and caption-edit setup):

- Place the script (index.php) in a web-accessible directory with some
  image files and/or subdirectories that contain image files.
- Create the qdig-files subdirectory if it doesn't already exist.
- Temporarily set world-writable (2777) permissions on the subdirectory.
- Browse the gallery directory's URL once.
- Set permissions on the subdirectory to something reasonable (like 0755).
- Place the admin.php script into the same directory as index.php.
- Edit admin.php script and add your username and password.
- Browse the directory's URL.


Quick Setup Instructions (Drag, drop, [set up a directory,] browse):

- On your desktop computer, create a folder with some image files 
  and/or subfolders with images that will become your gallery.
- Unpack the .zip version of the distribution archive and put the Qdig
  script (index.php) and its icon file (qdig-camera.ico) in the top
  folder of the directory tree.
- Using your favorite SCP or FTP file transfer program (FileZilla and
  WinSCP work well), drag the whole tree to your server.
- Optionally, set up the directory for writable files (see below).
- Optionally, install admin.php for editing captions:
  - Edit admin.php to add your username and password.
  - Put admin.php in the same directory on the server as index.php.
- Voilà!  You can browse through the photos.


Establishing The Writable Tree:

The writable directory tree is where Qdig writes converted images
(thumbnails and resized versions of large images) and empty caption
.txt files.

Note: Qdig can use either Image Magick or PHP's GD extensions to
convert (resample) images.  One of these needs to be available for
image conversion to work.

Establishing the writable directory tree is an easy procedure.

- Create the qdig-files subdirectory if it doesn't already exist.
- Temporarily set world-writable (2777) permissions on it.
- Browse the gallery directory's URL once.
- Set permissions on the subdirectory to something reasonable (0755).

More verbosely,

- In your main gallery directory create a subdirectory, called
  qdig-files by default, that will be the top directory of the
  writable tree.  You can do this with your FTP or SCP file management
  program by creating a New Folder named qdig-files, or from a
  command prompt with this command: `mkdir qdig-files'.
- Temporarily set world-writable permissions on the directory.  If
  possible, enable the "setgid bit" on the directory (2777 permissions,
  or drwxrwsrwx).  The command to do this is:  `chmod 2777 qdig-files'
  If you don't have command-line access, use your file management
  program to set at least 777 (drwxrwxrwx) world-writable permissions,
  or you can try using a cron job to set 2777 permissions.
- Use your web browser to visit your gallery's location once. When you
  do, two writable subdirectories will be created for you, one for
  captions and one for converted (resampled) image files.
- Now remove the world-writable permissions on the qdig-files directory.
  Set permissions to something reasonable, like 0755 (drwxr-xr-x).
  The command to do this is:  `chmod 0755 qdig-files'


Command Line Step-By-Step Instructions:

Here are example instructions for creating an empty Qdig gallery, ready
for images.  Of course you will need to adjust the locations of the html
document root and Qdig tarball file.

cd ~/public_html                   # Change the pwd to your document root.
mkdir photos                       # Create a gallery directory.
cd photos                          # Move to the directory.
tar -zxvf ~/tmp/qdig-1.x.x.tar.gz  # Unzip the tarball.
chmod 700 qdig/                    # Restrict access to the original files.
cp qdig/index.php .                # Copy the index.php file.
mkdir -p qdig-files                # Create the qdig-files directory.
chmod 2777 qdig-files              # Set writable/setgid permissions.
# (Browse the gallery URL)         # Allow Qdig to create directories.
chmod 0755 qdig-files              # Set non-world-writable permissions.

At this point your gallery is ready to go.  You can do some customization by
editing index.php and you can manage your images and comments using your
favorite FTP or SCP client.  If you want to use the new on-the-fly caption
editing feature, install the gallery management script:

cp qdig/admin.php .                # Copy the admin script file.
cp qdig/qdig-admin.ico .           # Copy the admin script icon.
# (Edit admin.php)                 # Add your username/password pair.

Once you have your gallery nicely customized you may want to create a
text file with the changes you made when you edited the script.

# Save settings changes
diff qdig/index.php index.php >qdig-settings.diff
chmod 600 qdig-settings.diff       # Restrict access to the file.

Optionally, you can delete the Qdig distribution files:

rm -rf qdig/                       # Delete Qdig distribution files.

Here's what your new empty gallery might look like:

photos/
|-- index.php
`-- qdig-files/
    |-- Security_Check_File--Safe_To_Delete
    |-- captions/
    `-- converted-images/

At this point you can manage your Qdig galleries using your favorite
FTP or SCP client or by simply adding/deleting images and gallery
directories on the filesystem using the command-line interface.

Qdig will create empty .txt caption files in the qdig-files/captions/
directory.  If you don't want captions, just delete that directory.

Thumbnails and alternate-size images will be written in
qdig-files/converted-images/.  Likewise, you can disable image
conversion by deleting the directory.

Here's what your gallery might look like after you install admin.php
(for editing captions) delete the security-check file:

photos/
|-- admin.php
|-- index.php
|-- qdig-admin.ico
`-- qdig-files/
    |-- captions/
    `-- converted-images/


Customizing Qdig:

Qdig has dozens of configurable settings.  They are briefly explained
in comments in the script.  Edit the script and configure some settings.
Experiment and have fun.  Since Qdig is a one-file program, your
changes will not carry forward if you update the script to a newer
version.  This may change in the future, but for now realize that
you'll need to re-establish your custom settings if you upgrade.


The Gallery Administration Script (admin.php):

Starting with Qdig 1.2.0, admin.php has been re-purposed to
allow you to edit image captions on-the-fly from image display
pages.  These days it's not useful for much other than that.
Use your favorite FTP/SCP client to manage your Qdig galleries.

Please note: admin.php is not for configuring Qdig settings.

You may also need the admin tool if you are unable to set 2777
permissions on the root folder of the writable tree during
installation, settling for 777 permissions instead.  If that
happens, files and directories created by Qdig are owned and
group-owned by the web server daemon's default UID and GID.
You cannot delete or modify them from the command line or
via FTP/SCP but you can delete or modify them using admin.php.

Installing the gallery administration script is an easy procedure.

- Place the script (admin.php) into the same directory as index.php.
- Use a text editor to edit the script and add your username and a
  good password.  (There's no default password for security reasons.)
- Optionally, place icon file (qdig-admin.ico) in the same directory.


Troubleshooting:

If you're not getting the results you expect you can enable diagnostic
messages by setting $diag_messages to TRUE.  This will cause the script
to display several lines of information at the bottom of gallery pages
that can be very helpful for getting your gallery up and running the
way you want.
See http://qdig.sourceforge.net/Support/DiagnosticMessages

If you are not seeing thumbnails and you are expecting them, make sure
you are requesting thumbs view by either having "Qiv=thumbs" in the URL
or having no query string (the "?" and everything after it deleted).

If your Fedora Core 3 server will not write files, see this page:

If your server is running in PHP Safe Mode, see this page:
